# Term Deposit Subscription

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns. 
It contains information about client demographics, loan history, marketing campaign details, and subscription history. 
The dataset is structured with both numerical and categorical attributes, making it suitable for classification tasks.

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the provided data. 
By leveraging H2O AutoML, we automate the process of training and selecting the best-performing machine-learning model for this classification task.
